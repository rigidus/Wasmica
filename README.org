#+TITLE: WebAssembly Lightweight Virtual Machine

* Intro

In this project, I implement an interpreter and JIT compiler for WebAssembly (Wasm) in C in a literate programming style, documenting and explaining the code as I write it.

I will start with the basic functionality and gradually add new features such as WASI support, debugging, and optimizations.

The goal of this document is to create a clear project roadmap that will serve both for implementation and maintenance.

We will start with the overall structure and then dive into the details of each component.

* Project Structure

The project consists of several key components, each responsible for its own part of working with WebAssembly:
- Wasm Parser - parses bytecode and builds an internal representation.
- Interpreter - executes Wasm code step by step.
- JIT compiler - speeds up execution through dynamic compilation.
- Runtime - manages memory and interaction with the host system.
- Debugging and profiling - provides tools for analyzing and fixing errors.
- REPL - an interactive shell for testing and debugging.

Each component is described in its own section to add code gradually while maintaining the overall picture of the project.
